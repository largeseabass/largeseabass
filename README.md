### Hiiii!

- ðŸŒ± I will share some useful python GIS scripts here:

Change Projection, Raster Calculator Example, Zonal Statistics with **pyQGIS** [https://github.com/largeseabass/KissingBugsRf](https://github.com/largeseabass/KissingBugsRf)
Average over 5 bands and produce a new raster with **gdal** [https://github.com/largeseabass/average_raster_band](https://github.com/largeseabass/average_raster_band).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ecology/infectious disease-related GIS and machine learning scripts in R, e.g. raster PCA function for large raster stack.
